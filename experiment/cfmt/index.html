	<p><b>The title of the study </b></p>


<p>Face Recognition </p>


<p><b>Invitation to take part </b></p>



<p>You are being invited to take part in a research project. Before you decide it is important for you to understand why the research is being done and what it will involve. Please take time to read the following information carefully and discuss it with others if you wish. Ask us if there is anything that is not clear or if you would like more information. Take time to decide whether or not you wish to take part. </p>
<p><b> What is the purpose of the project? </b></p>
<p>Meeting new people and remembering their faces is a common practice in every day social life. The current study aims to study this ability. Some people are better than others at remembering new faces. We are interested in studying such individual differences. We are looking for participants who are 18 years of age or older. </p>
<p><b>Why have I been chosen? </b></p>
<p>We are looking for Caucasian males and females, aged between 18 and 90, who have not taken a similar face recognition test before. </p>
<p><b>Do I have to take part? </b> </p>
<p>It is up to you to decide whether or not to take part.. You can withdraw from participation during the test at any time and without giving a reason. If you decide to withdraw we will remove any data collected from you. Once the test has finished you may still be able to withdraw your data up to the point where the anonymized data is analysed and incorporated into the research findings or outputs. Your identity cannot be determined, and it may not be possible to identify your data within the anonymous dataset. Withdrawing your data at this point may also adversely affect the validity and integrity of the research. Deciding to take part or not will not impact on our study. </p>
<p><b>What would taking part involve? </b></p>
<p>If you choose to take part, you will do a face recognition test. You will be shown some pictures of faces that you are not familiar with. You will be asked to remember them. Later your memory will be tested to see how well you can recognise them. The faces you have learnt could be tested in different images, showing the faces in a different angle or a lighting condition. After the recognition test, you will be asked to guess the ethnicity of the faces you have learnt then answer five questions about your experience with different ethnic groups. It will take you about 10-15 minutes to complete the study. </p>
<p><b>What are the advantages and possible disadvantages or risks of taking part? </b></p>
<p>Whilst there are no immediate benefits for those people participating in the project, it is hoped that this work will contribute the knowledge of face perception and recognition. There are no possible disadvantages or risks of taking part. </p>
<p><b>What type of information will be sought from me and why is the collection of this information relevant for achieving the research project’s objectives? </b></p>
<p>Your face recognition accuracy will be recorded. This will help us understand how people’s face recognition memory vary from each other, which is a main objective of our research. </p>
<p><b>Will I be recorded, and how will the recorded media be used? </b></p>
<p>No audio or video recordings of your activities will be made during this research. </p>

<p><b>How will we use information about you? </b></p>
<p>As mentioned, I will not record any personal information, other than basic demographical information (i.e., age and gender) which is needed for analyses and publication (the method section requires age and gender of participants).  No individuals will be identified in future publications. </p>
<p>Your data will be processed in accordance with the UK-GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018. Below is additional information that has not been addressed above. </p>
<ul>
<li>Your recognition accuracy will be retained until the data are published in academic journals. </li>
<li>Your anonymized data may be used to support future research and may be shared with other researchers. </li>
</ul>

<p><b>What are your choices about how your information is used? </b></p>

<p>You are free withdraw at any point of the study, without having to give a reason but I will keep information about you that I already have. </p>

<p>Your rights to access, change or move your information (e.g., age and gender) are limited, as we need to manage your information in specific ways in order for the research to be reliable and accurate. If you withdraw from the study, I will keep the information about you that I have already obtained. </p>

<p><b>What will happen to the results of the study? </b></p>
<p>The results of the study will be analysed for publications in academic journals or dissemination at academic conferences. </p>

<p><b>Who has reviewed this study? </b></p>
<p>Research studies are reviewed by an independent group of people, called a Research Ethics Committee, to protect your interests. </p>
