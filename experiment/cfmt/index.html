<p>Face Perception and Recognition </p>


<p>Invitation to take part </p>



<p>You are being invited to take part in a research project. Before you decide it is important for you to understand why the research is being done and what it will involve. Please take time to read the following information carefully and discuss it with others if you wish. Ask us if there is anything that is not clear or if you would like more information. Take time to decide whether or not you wish to take part. </p>


<p>Who is organising the research? </p>


<p>Principle researcher: 	Prof. Chang Hong Liu, Department of Psychology, Bournemouth University </p>

<p>Collaborators	Dr. Chengyang Han (Zhejiang University, China) </p>

<p>Dr. Emma Portch (Bournemouth University) </p>


<p>What is the purpose of the project? </p>


<p>Meeting new people and remembering their faces is a common practice in every day social life. The current study aims to study this ability. Some people are better than others at remembering new faces. We are interested in studying such individual differences. We are looking for participants who are 18 years of age or older. </p>


<p>Why have I been chosen? </p>


<p>We are looking for Caucasian males and females, aged between 18 and 90, who have not taken a similar face recognition test before. </p>


<p>Do I have to take part? </p>


<p>It is up to you to decide whether or not to take part. If you do decide to take part, you will be given this information sheet to keep and be asked to sign a participant agreement form.  You can withdraw from participation during the test at any time and without giving a reason.  If you decide to withdraw we will usually remove any data collected about you from the study.  Once the test has finished you may still be able to withdraw your data up to the point where the data is analysed and incorporated into the research findings or outputs. At this point your data will usually become anonymous, so your identity cannot be determined, and it may not be possible to identify your data within the anonymous dataset.  Withdrawing your data at this point may also adversely affect the validity and integrity of the research.  Deciding to take part or not will not impact on our study. </p>


<p>What would taking part involve? </p>


<p>If you choose to take part, you will do a face recognition test. You will be shown some pictures of faces that you are not familiar with. You will be asked to remember them. Later your memory will be tested to see how well you can recognise them. The faces you have learnt could be tested in different images, showing the faces in a different angle or a lighting condition. After the recognition test, you will be asked to guess the ethnicity of the faces you have learnt then answer five questions about your experience with different ethnic groups. It will take you about 10-15 minutes to complete the study. </p>


<p>What are the advantages and possible disadvantages or risks of taking part? </p>


<p>Whilst there are no immediate benefits for those people participating in the project, it is hoped that this work will contribute the knowledge of face perception and recognition. There are no possible disadvantages or risks of taking part. </p>


<p>What type of information will be sought from me and why is the collection of this information relevant for achieving the research project’s objectives? </p>


<p>You face recognition accuracy will be recorded. This will help us understand how people’s face recognition memory vary from each other, which is a main objective of our research. </p>


<p>Will I be recorded, and how will the recorded media be used? </p>


<p>No audio or video recordings of your activities will be made during this research.  </p>


<p>How will my information be kept? </p>


<p>All the information we collect about you during the course of the research will be kept strictly in accordance with current data protection legislation.  Research is a task that we perform in the public interest, as part of our core function as a university.  Bournemouth University (BU) is a Data Controller of your information, which means that we are responsible for looking after your information and using it appropriately.  BU’s Research Participant Privacy Notice sets out more information about how we fulfil our responsibilities as a data controller and about your rights as an individual under the data protection legislation.  We ask you to read this Notice so that you can fully understand the basis on which we will process your information.  </p>


<p>Publication </p>

<p>You will not be able to be identified in any external reports or publications about the research without your specific consent*.   Otherwise your information will only be included in these materials in an anonymous form, i.e. you will not be identifiable.  </p>


<p>Research results may be published in scientific journals. </p>


<p>Security and access controls </p>

<p>BU will hold the information we collect about you in hard copy in a secure location and on a BU password protected secure network where held electronically. </p>


<p>Except where it has been anonymised your personal information will be accessed and used only by appropriate, authorised individuals and when this is necessary for the purposes of the research or another purpose identified in the Privacy Notice. This may include giving access to BU staff or others responsible for monitoring and/or audit of the study, who need to ensure that the research is complying with applicable regulations. </p>


<p>Sharing and further use of your personal information </p>

<p>As well as BU staff and the BU student(s) working on the research project, we may also need to share personal information in non-anonymised for with Dr. Chengyang Han at Zhejiang University in China who may need to access the data because he is our external collaborator, who will work on the same project. </p>


<p>Retention of your data </p>

<p>All personal data collected for the purposes of this study will be held for one year from the date of publication of the research.  Although published research outputs are anonymised, we need to retain underlying data collected for the study in a non-anonymised form for a certain period to enable the research to be audited and/or to enable the research findings to be verified. </p>


<p>Contact for further information </p>


<p>If you have any questions or would like further information, please contact Prof. Chang Hong Liu (liuc@bournemouth.ac.uk) </p>


<p>In case of complaints </p>

<p>Any concerns about the study should be directed to Prof. Chang Hong Liu (liuc@bournemouth.ac.uk).  If you concerns have not been answered by Prof. Chang Hong Liu, you should contact the Deputy Dean for Research & Professional Practice, Professor Tiantian Zhang, Faculty of Science and Technology, Bournemouth University by email to researchgovernance@bournemouth.ac.uk. </p>



<p>Finally </p>


<p>If you decide to take part, you will be given a copy of the information sheet and a signed participant agreement form to keep. </p>


<p>Thank you for considering taking part in this research project. </p>
